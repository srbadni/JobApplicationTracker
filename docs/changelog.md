## 0.19.0 - June 23, 2026 - The crudauth Migration

Three changes since v0.18.0: route dependency injection moved to centralized `Annotated[...]` type aliases ([#261](https://github.com/job-tracker/job-tracker/pull/261)), the app metadata (`APP_NAME` / `APP_DESCRIPTION` / `VERSION`) became environment-configurable, and — the headline — the vendored authentication stack was replaced with the [`crudauth`](https://pypi.org/project/crudauth/) library.

**The crudauth migration.** The vendored authentication stack — the in-tree `SessionManager`, its storage backends, the OAuth provider framework, and the token/password utilities — has been replaced with crudauth. The project now keeps only the wiring: a single `auth = CRUDAuth(...)` singleton in `frameworks/auth/setup.py`, the FastAPI dependencies that wrap it, the OAuth building blocks, and the route handlers. Session validation, CSRF, login lockout, and session storage all live in the library.

**Annotated type-alias DI** ([#261](https://github.com/job-tracker/job-tracker/pull/261), by [@emiliano-gandini-outeda](https://github.com/emiliano-gandini-outeda)). Route signatures moved from inline `Depends(...)` to centralized `Annotated[..., Depends(...)]` aliases in `frameworks/dependencies.py`, with per-module `dependencies.py` files holding the service aliases for `user`, `tier`, `rate_limit`, and `api_keys`.

This is a **breaking** change for anyone importing from the old auth modules or relying on the removed settings. See Breaking Changes below for the migration.

---

#### Added

- **`crudauth` library integration** by [@igorbenav](https://github.com/igorbenav)
  - `auth = CRUDAuth(...)` composition root in `frameworks/auth/setup.py`; the app lifespan calls `auth.initialize()` / `auth.shutdown()`
  - New `Principal`-based dependencies `get_current_principal` / `get_optional_principal` alongside the dict-returning `get_current_user` / `get_optional_user` / `get_current_superuser`
- **`TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` setting** (default `0`) — number of trusted reverse proxies in front of the app, used by crudauth to resolve the real client IP for login lockout. Set `1` behind a single nginx/Caddy.
- **`User.is_active` property** — derived from `not is_deleted`; crudauth reads it during login so soft-deleted users can't authenticate.
- **Annotated type-alias dependency injection** ([#261](https://github.com/job-tracker/job-tracker/pull/261)) by [@emiliano-gandini-outeda](https://github.com/emiliano-gandini-outeda) — centralized `Annotated[..., Depends(...)]` aliases in `frameworks/dependencies.py` and per-module `dependencies.py` (`user`, `tier`, `rate_limit`, `api_keys`) with service aliases; route signatures migrated to use them.

#### Changed

- Auth dependencies now import from `infrastructure.auth.dependencies` (was `infrastructure.auth.session.dependencies`).
- `get_password_hash` / `verify_password` now come `from crudauth` (was `infrastructure.auth.utils`).
- Login lockout now returns **`429 Too Many Requests` with a `Retry-After` header** (was a generic `401`). It is throttled internally by crudauth (escalating per-IP / per-identifier), not via env vars.
- OAuth providers are now registered via crudauth's `OAuthProviderFactory` in `frameworks/auth/oauth.py` rather than as separate `oauth/providers/<name>.py` files. Google remains wired.
- `APP_NAME`, `APP_DESCRIPTION`, and `VERSION` are now environment-configurable (read via `config(...)`; previously hardcoded).
- `/check-auth` now answers anonymous callers with `{"authenticated": false}` instead of raising `401` ([#261](https://github.com/job-tracker/job-tracker/pull/261)).

#### Removed

- The vendored session stack: `SessionManager`, the memory/redis/memcached session backends, session storage/schemas/dependencies, and the user-agent parsing helpers.
- The in-tree OAuth package (provider framework, factory, `providers/google.py`, `providers/github.py`, services) and `auth/utils.py` / `auth/constants.py`.
- The **memcached session backend** — sessions now support only `redis` and `memory`. (The general cache and rate limiter still support memcached.)
- The GitHub OAuth provider file. The `User` model keeps its `github_id` / `oauth_provider` columns, so the data model still anticipates GitHub, but no provider or routes ship.
- Settings `ALGORITHM`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS`, `SESSION_COOKIE_MAX_AGE`, `LOGIN_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, and `LOGIN_WINDOW_MINUTES`.
- The dependency aliases `SessionManagerDep`, `CurrentSessionDataDep`, `OptionalSessionDataDep`, `GoogleOAuthProviderDep`, and `OAuthStateStorageDep`.

#### Breaking Changes

- **Imports moved.** Replace `from ...infrastructure.auth.session.dependencies import ...` with `from ...infrastructure.auth.dependencies import ...`, and import `get_password_hash` / `verify_password` from `crudauth`.
- **Removed settings.** Delete `ALGORITHM`, `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES`, `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS`, `SESSION_COOKIE_MAX_AGE`, `LOGIN_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, and `LOGIN_WINDOW_MINUTES` from your environment — they no longer exist. Add `TRUSTED_PROXY_HOPS` if you run behind a proxy.
- **Login lockout response changed** from `401` to `429` + `Retry-After`; update any client that special-cased the old status/message.
- **`SESSION_BACKEND=memcached` is no longer valid** — switch to `redis` or `memory`.
- **`SessionManager` and friends are gone.** Code that called the session manager directly (e.g. listing a user's sessions) must move to crudauth's session APIs.

## 0.18.0 - May 24, 2026 - The Pluggable Restructure

This is the release we promised in v0.17.0; the one that tears the layout apart and rebuilds it as a real plugin system. If you've been pinned to v0.17.0 waiting for it, this is your moment.

A heads-up before we go further: **the diff is enormous**; v0.17.0 → v0.18.0 is not the kind of upgrade you run `git pull` for. The Python package moved, auth changed completely, workers changed, the admin panel changed, there's a new CLI in a new workspace member. We didn't do this lightly.

### Why this release is so different

We didn't iterate on the v0.17.0 codebase to get here. We **rebased the project on the [job-tracker](https://job-tracker.ai) structure**.

job-tracker is the production-tested template we use internally (and sell) for AI SaaS products. It's been running real apps for months and the structural choices (three-layer architecture, vertical-slice modules, server-side sessions, SQLAdmin, Taskiq, swappable infrastructure) have proven themselves under load. Reinventing all of that for job-tracker would have meant another six months of polish; rebasing meant we could ship the good parts on day one.

The trade-off is that job-tracker carries a lot of stuff this project's audience doesn't necessarily need: a Stripe integration, subscription/credits/entitlements modeling, AI agent orchestration, usage tracking with cost calculation, OAuth-specific provisioning for SaaS, an Astro frontend. Excellent for an AI SaaS starter, wrong for a general job-tracker.

**So this release is job-tracker minus the SaaS/AI parts, plus a plugin system that job-tracker doesn't have.** What's left is the structural skeleton; the parts that any FastAPI app needs and that we've watched hold up in real use:

- The three-layer split (`interfaces/`, `frameworks/`, `modules/`)
- Vertical-slice modules (`user/`, `tier/`, `api_keys/`, `rate_limit/`)
- Server-side sessions + CSRF, OAuth (Google wired, GitHub scaffolded)
- SQLAdmin, Taskiq, swappable cache/session/rate-limit backends
- The production security validator that refuses to boot with insecure defaults

The new part, the one job-tracker doesn't have, is **`job-tracker` — a plugin-aware CLI**. job-tracker ships everything in-tree because that's appropriate for an AI SaaS starter. job-tracker's whole pitch is "use what you need, drop what you don't", and that pitch only works if dropping things and adding things are first-class operations. The `job_tracker.commands` and `job_tracker.features` entry points are how external Python packages contribute new commands and feature generators without touching the core. Build a Stripe plugin, a Prometheus plugin, a CRUD-generator plugin, they all ship as separate packages.

### If you can stay on v0.17.0, consider it

For brand-new projects, v0.18.0 is the better starting point. For existing apps with significant custom code on v0.17.0, the honest answer is: **the migration path is "copy your business logic into the new structure"**, not a sed-style find-and-replace. If your fork has diverged from v0.17.0 in non-trivial ways, pinning to v0.17.0 may be the right call. We'll keep v0.17.0 around as a tag forever.

  - README slimmed but still self-contained

- **Lint enforcement: `PLC0415`** by [@igorbenav](https://github.com/igorbenav)
  - No deferred imports anywhere — all imports at module top
  - Surfaced and resolved a circular import in session storage by extracting `AbstractSessionStorage` to `auth/session/base.py`

- **README polish** by [@carlosplanchon](https://github.com/carlosplanchon)

- **`mkdocs.yml`** — replaced by `zensical.toml`
- **Demo `posts` module** — pure demo code, not needed
- **`backend/uv.lock`** — stale duplicate of workspace `uv.lock`

#### Breaking Changes

⚠️ Eight breaking changes. The migration path for forks with significant custom code is "copy your business logic into the new structure" — there is no sed-style find-and-replace.

| Change | Impact | Migration |
|---|---|---|
| `src/app/` layout removed | Imports break at import time | Manual restructure into `modules/<name>/` |
| JWT removed | `Authorization: Bearer` clients rejected | Switch clients to cookie auth |
| CRUDAdmin → SQLAdmin | Custom admin views need porting | Port to `ModelView` shape |
| ARQ → Taskiq | Workers need re-registration | Rewrite tasks as `@broker.task` async functions |
| API key hash format | Existing keys won't validate | Users must regenerate |
| Settings composition | Env var names mostly stable; a few moved | Diff `.env.example` |
| Sync command | `cd backend && uv sync --extra dev` produces broken venv | Use `uv sync --all-packages --all-extras` from repo root |
| Deployment scaffolder | `./setup.py local` removed | `uv run job-tracker deploy generate {local,prod,nginx}` |

For brand-new projects, v0.18.0 is the better starting point. For existing apps with significant custom code on v0.17.0, **pinning to v0.17.0 may be the right call** — that tag stays supported.

#### New Co-Maintainers

- [@carlosplanchon](https://github.com/carlosplanchon) and [@emiliano-gandini-outeda](https://github.com/emiliano-gandini-outeda) are now officially helping maintain and improve the project.
